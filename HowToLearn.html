        <h1>Experiment 1: Active Recall Arena (Retrieval vs. Rereading)</h1>

        <h3>Phase 1: Observation</h3>
        <p class="explanation">This is your initial, personal reflection on your current study habits and academic performance. It is the necessary starting point for the scientific process, providing the real-world problem that this experiment will attempt to solve using learning science.</p>
        
        <div class="phase-content">
            <p><strong>Student Observation (Verbatim):</strong></p>
            <blockquote class="verbatim-observation">My go-to study method is to read my notes and the textbook over and over. It feels comfortable and familiar, and after a few passes, I start to recognize the material. But when I'm in the exam and have to write down answers from scratch, I freeze. I realize I never actually practiced retrieving the information on my own. I've been recognizing things instead of really learning them, and my C grades show it.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <h3>Phase 2: Curiosity</h3>
        <p class="explanation">Curiosity is a broad, open-ended question that emerges directly from the core of your personal observation. It explores the *why*—the underlying reason your current study method (rereading/recognition) is failing to produce the desired outcome (good grades/retrieval).</p>
        
        <div class="phase-content">
            <p><strong>Example Curiosity Question:</strong> *Why does the comfortable feeling of simply recognizing material during study sessions not translate into the ability to recall that information on a high-stakes exam?*</p>
            <p><strong>Student Input Required:</strong> Please input your own Curiosity Question based on your observation (a minimum of 50 words):</p>
            <textarea id="curiosity-input" placeholder="Enter your Curiosity Question here..."></textarea>
        </div>

        <h3>Phase 3: Research Question</h3>
        <p class="explanation">The Research Question is a specific, focused, and testable refinement of your broad Curiosity. It guides the design of the experiment by asking for a measurable comparison between two different conditions. For this experiment, we compare your current method (Rereading) against the alternative suggested by the learning science literature (Retrieval Practice).</p>

        <div class="phase-content">
            <p><strong>Research Question:</strong><br>
            Is **retrieval practice (active recall)** a more effective study method for long-term retention and performance on exams requiring written answers than **repeated rereading (passive study)**?</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Phase 4: Critical Hypothesis</h3>
        <p class="explanation">A hypothesis is an educated, testable prediction that attempts to answer the research question. It identifies the Independent Variable (the study method) and the Dependent Variable (the test score) and posits a clear relationship. The *critical* part is predicting which method will be *more* effective.</p>

        <div class="phase-content">
            <p><strong>Your Hypothesis:</strong><br>
            The use of **retrieval practice (active recall)** will result in a significantly better delayed test performance and higher retention than the use of **repeated rereading** for the same study material.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Phase 5: (If....Then) Prediction</h3>
        <p class="explanation">The final prediction is a precise, measurable statement of the expected outcome of the experiment, assuming your Hypothesis is correct. It links the action taken in the study to the data you expect to see.</p>

        <div class="phase-content">
            <p><strong>Prediction:</strong><br>
            **If** a student studies one set of flashcards using **retrieval practice** and a matching set of flashcards using **repeated rereading**, **then** the student will score a **higher percentage** on a final test for the retrieval practice material than for the rereading material.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Experiment Design & Procedure</h2>
        <p>The goal is now to test this prediction using a controlled, randomized study method.</p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Group</th>
                    <th>Study Method (Independent Variable)</th>
                    <th>Expected Outcome (Dependent Variable)</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>**Control**</td>
                    <td>Repeated Rereading (Your current method)</td>
                    <td>Lower score/freezing</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>**Treatment**</td>
                    <td>Retrieval Practice (Active Recall)</td>
                    <td>Higher score/better recall</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="procedure-step">**Preparation:** Divide the study material (e.g., 20 complex terms from a textbook chapter, two different historical timelines) into **Set A** and **Set B** of equal length and perceived difficulty.</li>
            <li class="procedure-step">**Control (Rereading):** Study **Set A** by reading the material 4 times over a 30-minute session. Do not cover the answers or quiz yourself.</li>
            <li class="procedure-step">**Treatment (Retrieval Practice):** Study **Set B** by reading the material once, then covering the answers and attempting to write everything you can remember from scratch for the remaining time. Repeat the recall/check/recall cycle 4 times over the same 30-minute session.</li>
            <li class="procedure-step">**Delay:** Wait 48 hours (or 1 week, based on your course schedule) to simulate the delayed testing conditions of your observation.</li>
            <li class="procedure-step">**Test:** Take a single, cumulative test on both Set A and Set B material. The test must require you to **write down answers from scratch** (simulating the type of exam where you freeze).</li>
            <li class="procedure-step">**Measure:** Grade the test and calculate the percentage score for Set A (Rereading) and Set B (Retrieval Practice).</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: right; margin-top: 30px;">*(The next phase would be **Phase 6: Data Collection and Analysis**.)*</p>
